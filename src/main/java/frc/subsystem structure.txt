drivetrain should be its own subsystem.
    mecanum drive with 4 motors
        can IDs 3 thru 6 should be drive motors
            CANsparkmax + NEO brushless
    can ID 20 should be gyroscope
            CTRE pigeon2
    should have PIDF controlled heading
    commands
        drive
            drive in field-centric or robot-centric through passed bool

Shooter should be its own subsytem.
    2 motors for intake, 2 motors for shooter
        can IDs 7+8 are intake.
            CANsparkmax + NEO550 brushless
        can IDs 9+10 are shooter. 
            shooter motor velocity controlled by PIDF controller
    commands
        shoot
            spin up shooter to passed velocity, feed note into shooter
        intake
            run intake until note is detected in shooter
        shooter_eject
            eject note at low speed
        intake_eject
            run intake in reverse to eject jammed note
        
climbers should be its own subsystem.
    can IDs 11+12 are climbers.
    absolute encoder used to detect position of climbers
    conditionals used to run climbers up or downs
    commands
        override
            run climber at passed speed, no safeties, used by extend and retract to operate
        extend
            run climber up until at setpoint
            if encoder is not set correctly and safety switch is triggered, abort command
            utilize override to run climber
        retract
            run climber down until at encoder zero
            if encoder is not set correctly and safety switch is triggered, abort command
            utilize override to run climber
        setzero
            run climber down at slow speed until safety switch is triggered
            reset encoder counts + small offset to keep off switch
            needs ran at least once per robot running cycle to relearn retracted position
            climbers must be slightly off retracted or switch triggered to function
